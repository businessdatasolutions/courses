## Prerequisites {.unnumbered}

Before starting this module make sure you have:

-   access to the book *Provost, F., & Fawcett, T. (2013). Data Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking. O'Reilly Media, Inc.*
-   installed [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

## Purpose of this course {.unnumbered}

The general learning outcome of this course is:

> The student is able to perform a well-defined task independently in a relatively clearly arranged situation, or is able to perform in a complex and unpredictable situation under supervision.

The course will provide you with a few essential data mining skills. The focus will lie on non-linear modeling techniques - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Naive Bayes classification.

After a successful completion of the course, a student:

-   is able to prepare data for a given non-linear model
-   train en test a non-linear model
-   evaluate the quality of a trained model

```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
weeknr <- c("2", "3-4", "5-6", "7")
module <- c("Onboarding and Introduction to the Course", "Lazy Learning with kNN", "Probabilistic Learning with Naive Bayes Classification", "Project Application")
reading <- c("Provost / Fawcett Ch.3", "Provost / Fawcett Ch.6 + 7", "Provost / Fawcett Ch.9", "")
headers <- c("Week nr.", "Module name", "Readings")
programmeDF <- data.frame(weeknr, module, reading)
colnames(programmeDF) <- headers

knitr::kable(
  programmeDF, longtable = TRUE, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Course overview'
)
```

Through the whole of the program you'll be cooperating within a team where you will combine and compare the results of the different case studies. At the end of the course you will present with your team what you have learned from analyzing and comparing the different case studies.
