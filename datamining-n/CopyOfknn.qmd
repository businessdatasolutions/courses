K-nearest neighbors is an algorithm that is commonly used in data mining. It works by identifying the k-nearest data points to a given point, and using their values to predict the value of the point in question.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
index <- c("2")
topic <- c("K-Nearest Neighbors")
tasks <- c("Build a k-nearest neighbors model and explain how it may be used to predict the values of data points.")
activities <- c("Follow along: students will participate in a guided demo of a data mining process building a model using K-Nearest Neighbors and evaluating its accuracy using a Confusion Matrix.")
student <- c("'We learned about the KNN algorithm, its advantages and limitations, as well as how to interpret a confusion matrix to evaluate the accuracy of a model.'")
teacher <- c("'Our goal here is to understand how data mining algorithms work and how they can be applied to real-world problems. As a teacher, my role is to clarify any doubts and ensure that everyone is actively participating. As students, you will be challenged to apply your knowledge to a problem and think critically.'")
headers <- c("","Topic", "Tasks", "Activities", "Student", "Teacher")
outlineDF <- data.frame(index, topic, tasks, activities, student, teacher)
colnames(outlineDF) <- headers

knitr::kable(
  outlineDF, longtable = TRUE, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Lesson outline'
)
```
