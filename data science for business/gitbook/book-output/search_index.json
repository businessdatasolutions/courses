(2013). Data Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking. O’Reilly Media, Inc. installed R and RStudio a Github account Purpose of this course The general learning outcome of this course is: The student is able to perform a well-defined task independently in a relatively clearly arranged situation, or is able to perform in a complex and unpredictable situation under supervision. The course will provide you with a non-technical overview of data science, and types of techniques. The focus will lie on critical thinking and the full DS process (based on CRISP).

You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? Figure 1.2: The Monty Hall Problem taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem Solution Before checking, try to derive a solution yourself. Solution Instead of trying to find an answer by reasoning we could write an algorithm that would play the game for us. Below you see one run ## There are 3 doors: 0 1 0 ## Player chose door nr: 3 , with reward: 0 ## Host opens door. Remaining door has reward 1 and the total wins when eached strategy is tried a 100,000 times. Apparently you have a 67% chance of winning when switching doors. Think: The problem was simple. Was it also a simple cognitive task? How much do you trust the solution above? 1.1.2 Taxicab problem In a study done by Tversky and Kahneman (1981) subjects were given the following problem: A cab was involved in a hit and run accident at night. Two cab companies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city. 85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue. A witness identified the cab as Blue. The court tested the reliability of the witness under the same circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness correctly identified each one of the two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time. What is the probability that the cab involved in the accident was Blue rather than Green knowing that this witness identified it as Blue? Solution Before checking, try to derive a solution yourself. Solution There is a 12% chance (15% times 80%) of the witness correctly identifying a blue cab. There is a 17% chance (85% times 20%) of the witness incorrectly identifying a green cab as blue. There is therefore a 29% chance (12% plus 17%) the witness will identify the cab as blue. This results in a 41% chance (12% divided by 29%) that the cab identified as blue is actually blue. Again we could write a simulation where we present 10,000 cabs to the witness and let him assess the color. Below you see one run of the simulation and in the chart the total count per cab. The red color represents all the cabs that were wrongly assessed. ## Cab was B ## and witness saw G ## cab observed ## &quot;B&quot; &quot;G&quot; According to the simulation the reliability of the witness when he states that he saw a blue cab is 43%. Most subjects gave probabilities over 50%, and some gave answers over 80%. The correct answer is lower than these estimates. Think: Suppose that at the start of the trial the Blue Taxi Company tells the judge that they are not guilty. The witness is heard. How much do you think this would influence the opinion of a typical person? How much do you think it should influence? Do you think all judges have the analytical skills to calculate probabilities? 1.2 What is Data Science and what is not?
