You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? Figure 1.2: The Monty Hall Problem taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem Solution Before checking, try to derive a solution yourself. Solution Instead of trying to find an answer by reasoning we could write an algorithm that would play the game for us. Below you see one run ## There are 3 doors: 1 0 0 ## Player chose door nr: 3 , with reward: 0 ## Host opens door. Remaining door has reward 1 and the total wins when eached strategy is tried a 100,000 times. 1.2 What is Data Science and what is not?
