(2013). Data Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking. O’Reilly Media, Inc. installed R and RStudio a Github account Purpose of this course The general learning outcome of this course is: The student is able to perform a well-defined task independently in a relatively clearly arranged situation, or is able to perform in a complex and unpredictable situation under supervision. The course will provide you with a non-technical overview of data science, and types of techniques. The focus will lie on critical thinking and the full DS process (based on CRISP).

You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? Figure 1.2: The Monty Hall Problem taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem Solution Before checking, try to derive a solution yourself. Solution Instead of trying to find an answer by reasoning we could write an algorithm that would play the game for us. Below you see one run ## There are 3 doors: 1 0 0 ## Player chose door nr: 1 , with reward: 1 ## Host opens door. Remaining door has reward 0 and the total wins when eached strategy is tried a 100,000 times. Apparently you have a 66% chance of winning when switching doors. Think: The problem was simple. Was it also a simple cognitive task? Do you trust the solution above? 1.2 What is Data Science and what is not?
