Please watch the first 15 minutes and then aswer the questions. Assignments: Write down all associations you can discover between the study material (Provost Ch.1) and the video. Apart from data driven what are other methods for decision making? 1.2 Thinking and Deciding 1.2.1 The Johan Cruyff Arena Figure 1.2: Johan Cuyff Arena Amsterdam taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff_Arena#/media/File:Ajax_0_Chelsea_1_(23Oct19).jpg Suppose someone drops a water drop in de Johan Cruyff Arena on the center spot, a second later two drops, after another second four drops, etc. How long would it take to flood the Arena? Solution Before checking, make your own estimate. Solution Figure 1.3: Simulation of Arena flooding - own work Think: How well did you guess? 1.2.2 The Monty Hall Problem Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? Figure 1.4: The Monty Hall Problem taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem Solution Before checking, try to derive a solution yourself. Solution Instead of trying to find an answer by reasoning we could write an algorithm that would play the game for us. Below you see one run. ## There are 3 doors: 1 0 0 ## Player chose door nr: 2 , with reward: 0 ## Host opens door. Remaining door has reward 1 and the total wins when eached strategy is tried a 100,000 times. Apparently you have a 67% chance of winning when switching doors. Think: The problem was simple. Was it also a simple cognitive task? How much do you trust the solution above? 1.2.3 Taxicab problem In a study done by Tversky and Kahneman (1981) subjects were given the following problem: A cab was involved in a hit and run accident at night. Two cab companies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city. 85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue. A witness identified the cab as Blue. The court tested the reliability of the witness under the same circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness correctly identified each one of the two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time. What is the probability that the cab involved in the accident was Blue rather than Green knowing that this witness identified it as Blue? Solution Before checking, try to derive a solution yourself. Solution There is a 12% chance (15% times 80%) of the witness correctly identifying a blue cab. There is a 17% chance (85% times 20%) of the witness incorrectly identifying a green cab as blue. There is therefore a 29% chance (12% plus 17%) the witness will identify the cab as blue. This results in a 41% chance (12% divided by 29%) that the cab identified as blue is actually blue. Again we could write a simulation where we present 10,000 cabs to the witness and let him assess the color. Below you see one run of the simulation and in the chart the total count per cab. The red color represents all the cabs that were wrongly assessed. ## Cab was B ## and witness saw G ## cab observed ## &quot;B&quot; &quot;G&quot; According to the simulation the reliability of the witness when he states that he saw a blue cab is 41%. Most subjects gave probabilities over 50%, and some gave answers over 80%. The correct answer is lower than these estimates. Think: Suppose that at the start of the trial the Blue Taxi Company tells the judge that they are not guilty. The witness is heard. How much do you think this would influence the opinion of a typical person? How much do you think it should influence? Do you think all judges have the analytical skills to calculate probabilities? 1.3 What is Data Science and what is not?

What questions could be asked during data understanding? 2.2 Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Methods 2.2.1 Supervised vs Unsupervised Methods 2.2.2 Reinforcement Methods 2.3 The Data Mining Process Figure 2.1: CRISP-DM Model taken from: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CRISP-DM_Process_Diagram.png 2.3.1 Formulating a business problem Business Case: Recognizing handwritten digits Table 2.1: ECLIPSE questions taken from Wildridge and Bell (2002) Mnemonic Question Answer E Expectation: Why does the user want the information? A utility company wants to scan the electricity meter readings it receives from clients through paper forms and save them to a database C Client Group: For whom is the service / product intended? The Billing Department L Location: Where is the service / product sited? This is an internal process I Impact: What would represent success? How is this measured? To reach at least human accuracy P Professionals: Who provides or improves the service / product? At the moment this is done by hand SE Service: What type of service / product is under consideration? The readings are used to prepare invoices 2.3.2 Data Understanding We are going to train a model on data from the MNIST database (LeCun 1998). The original dataset contains 60000 images of handwritten digits. The size of each images is 28x28 pixel and each pixel has a grayscale value between 0 (white) en 255 (black). Figure 2.2: Example taken from Robinson (2018) 2.3.3 Data Preparation How much gray is there in the set of images? Example Mnist Robinson (2018) Figure 2.3: Example taken from Robinson (2018) Solution Before checking, analyze the chart and draw your own conclusions. Solution Most pixels in the dataset are completely white, along with another set of pixels that are completely dark, with relatively few in between. Think: Let’s assume the images were black and whit photographs of landscapes or faces. Would you expect the same color distribution as above? How much variability is there within each digit label? Do all 3s look like each other, and what is the “most typical” example of a 6? To answer this, we can find the mean value for each position within each label and visualize these average digits as ten separate facets. These averaged images are called centroids. We’re treating each image as a 784-dimensional point (28 by 28), and then taking the average of all points in each dimension individually. Figure 2.4: Example taken from Robinson (2018) Solution Before checking, analyze the chart and draw your own conclusions. Solution Already we have some suspicions about which digits might be easier to separate. Distinguishing 0 and 1 looks pretty straightforward: you could pick a few pixels at the center (always dark in 1 but not 0), or at the left and right edges (often dark in 0 but not 1), and you’d have a pretty great classifier. Pairs like 4/9, or 3/8, have a lot more overlap and will be a more challenging problem. Which digits have more variability on average? So far, this machine learning problem might seem a bit easy: we have some very “typical” versions of each digit. But one of the reasons classification can be challenging is that some digits will fall widely outside the norm. It’s useful to explore atypical cases, since it could help us understand why the method fails and help us choose a method and engineer features. In this case, we could consider the Euclidean distance (square root of the sum of squares) of each image to its label’s centroid. Figure 2.5: Example taken from Robinson (2018) Solution Before checking, analyze the chart and draw your own conclusions. Solution It looks like 1s have especially low distances to their centroid: for the most part there’s not a ton of variability in how people draw that digit. It looks like the most variability by this measure are in 0s and 2s. But every digit has at least a few cases with an unusually large distance from their centroid. I wonder what those look like? To discover this, we can visualize the six digit instances that had the least resemblance to their central digit. Figure 2.6: Example taken from Robinson (2018) This is a useful way to understand what kinds of problems the data could have. For instance, while most 1s looked the same, they could be drawn diagonally, or with a flat line and a flag on top. A 7 could be drawn with a bar in the middle. (And what is up with that 9 on the lower left?) This also gives us a realistic sense of how accurate our classifier can get. Even humans would have a hard time classifying some of these sloppy digits, so we can’t expect a 100% success rate. Conversely, if one of our classifiers does get a 100% success rate, we should examine whether we’re overfitting! How easy it is to tell pairs of digits apart? To examine this, we could try overlapping pairs of our centroid digits, and taking the difference between them. If two centroids have very little overlap, this means they’ll probably be easy to distinguish. Figure 2.7: Example taken from Robinson (2018) Solution Before checking, analyze the chart and draw your own conclusions. Solution Pairs with very red or very blue regions will be easy to classify, since they describe features that divide the datasets neatly. This confirms our suspicion about 0/1 being easy to classify: it has substantial regions than are deeply red or blue. Comparisons that are largely white may be more difficult. We can see 4/9 looks pretty challenging, which makes sense (a handwritten 4 and 9 really differ only by a small region at the top). 7/9 shows a similar challenge. 2.3.4 Modeling and Evaluation For modeling we can use a neural network. Follow this link and let thee model run. When finished you’ll see a table resembling the following: Figure 2.8: Example Machine Learning output How well does the model perform? 2.3.5 Deployment MNIST Handwriting See the Pen MNIST handwritten digits - ML by Witusj ((Witusj?)) on CodePen. 2.4 Databases 2.4.1 SQL vs NoSQL If you work with Excel or store your data in MySQL, you are used to storing data in rows and columns. For example, if you store customer data: Table 2.2: A data table First Last Witold ten Hove Caroline Tensen Each line is a customer, each column a variable, and each cell contains one value. However, suppose you want to store all of your customers’ phone numbers and some customers have multiple phone numbers. One option is to store all telephone numbers in one cell: Table 2.3: A data-table with mutiple values in one cell First Last Telephone Witek ten Hove 06111111; 06222222 Caroline Tensen 06333333 However, this can cause a problem when exporting or searching the data. As soon as your data seems to become asymmetric, you should consider a NoSQL format. The most important formats in terms of popularity are XML and JSON. 2.4.1.1 XML By annotating data, meaning can be added to individual data elements. One data format that makes use of this is Extensible Markup Language (XML). For example, in our example, a tag can be added to the data relating to the first name and each telephone number can be individually identified as such. ## ## &lt;customers&gt; ## &lt;customer&gt; ## &lt;First&gt;Witek&lt;/First&gt; ## &lt;Last&gt;ten Hove&lt;/Last&gt; ## &lt;Telephone&gt;06111111&lt;/Telephone&gt; ## &lt;Telephone&gt;06222222&lt;/Telephone&gt; ## &lt;/customer&gt; ## &lt;customer&gt; ## &lt;First&gt;Caroline&lt;/First&gt; ## &lt;Last&gt;Tensen&lt;/Last&gt; ## &lt;Telephone&gt;06333333&lt;/Telephone&gt; ## &lt;/customer&gt; ## &lt;/customers&gt; Using this method we can easily add data. For instance a second name. ## ## &lt;customers&gt; ## &lt;customer&gt; ## &lt;First&gt;Witold&lt;/First&gt; ## &lt;First&gt;Frederik&lt;/First&gt; ## &lt;Last&gt;ten Hove&lt;/Last&gt; ## &lt;Telephone&gt;06111111&lt;/Telephone&gt; ## &lt;Telephone&gt;06222222&lt;/Telephone&gt; ## &lt;/customer&gt; ## &lt;customer&gt; ## &lt;First&gt;Caroline&lt;/First&gt; ## &lt;First&gt;Egbertine&lt;/First&gt; ## &lt;Last&gt;Tensen&lt;/Last&gt; ## &lt;Telephone&gt;06333333&lt;/Telephone&gt; ## &lt;/customer&gt; ## &lt;/customers&gt; 2.4.1.2 JSON For a long time XML was the leading data format for web applications. However is has currently been overtaken by Javascript Object Notation (JSON). Figure 2.9: Bron: Stack Overflow The main reason for this change has been the increasin popularity of so-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Many online service providers offer also the possibility to access selected data. Most modern web applications are written using Javascript and can process JSON natively. This concept simplifies the integration of various datasources dramatically. For instance one application could combine tweets from Twitter with weather forecasts and with news from CNN. JSON works through so-called key: value sets: ## [ ## { ## &quot;First&quot;: &quot;Witold&quot;, ## &quot;Last&quot;: &quot;ten Hove&quot;, ## &quot;Telephone&quot;: &quot;06111111&quot; ## }, ## { ## &quot;First&quot;: &quot;Caroline&quot;, ## &quot;Last&quot;: &quot;Tefsen&quot;, ## &quot;Telephone&quot;: &quot;06333333&quot; ## } ## ] If a value consists of many elements these are stored in arrays. ## [ ## { ## &quot;First&quot;: [&quot;Witold&quot;, &quot;Frederik&quot;], ## &quot;Last&quot;: &quot;ten Hove&quot;, ## &quot;Telephone&quot;: [&quot;06111111&quot;, &quot;06222222&quot;] ## }, ## { ## &quot;First&quot;: [&quot;Caroline&quot;, &quot;Egbertine&quot;], ## &quot;Last&quot;: &quot;Tefsen&quot;, ## &quot;Telephone&quot;: &quot;06333333&quot; ## } ## ] The arrays are indexed, so each element can be easily retrieved. 2.4.2 Graph 2.5 Business Case Big Data is not reserved for Big Business.
