## Formulating a business problem

```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
mnemonic <- c("E", "C", "L", "I", "P", "SE")
description <- c("Expectation: Why does the user want the information?", "Client Group: For whom is the service intended?", "Location:  Where is the service physically sited?", "Impact: What would represent success?  How is this measured?", "Professionals: Who provides or improves the service?", "Service: What type of service is under consideration?")

headers <- c("Mnemonic", "Description")
programmeDF <- data.frame(mnemonic, description)
colnames(programmeDF) <- headers

knitr::kable(
  programmeDF, longtable = TRUE, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'ECLIPSE questions taken from @wildridge_eclipse_2002'
)
```
