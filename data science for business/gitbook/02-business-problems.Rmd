## The Data Mining Process

```{r datamining-fig, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.75, fig.cap='CRISP-DM Model taken from: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CRISP-DM_Process_Diagram.png', message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep('images/crisp.png'))
```

### Formulating a business problem

```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
mnemonic <- c("E", "C", "L", "I", "P", "SE")
description <- c("Expectation: Why does the user want the information?", "Client Group: For whom is the service / product intended?", "Location:  Where is the service / product sited?", "Impact: What would represent success?  How is this measured?", "Professionals: Who provides or improves the service / product?", "Service: What type of service / product is under consideration?")

headers <- c("Mnemonic", "Description")
programmeDF <- data.frame(mnemonic, description)
colnames(programmeDF) <- headers

knitr::kable(
  programmeDF, longtable = TRUE, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'ECLIPSE questions taken from @wildridge_eclipse_2002'
)
```
