Formulating a business problem using ECLIPSE [@wildridge_eclipse_2002]

```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
mnemonic <- c("E", "C", "L", "I", "P", "SE")
description <- c("Expectation: Why does the user want the information?", "C - Client Group: For whom is the service intended?", "L –   Location:  Where is the service physically sited?", "Impact: What would represent success?  How is this measured?", "P –   Professionals: Who provides or improves the service?", "SE – Service: What type of service is under consideration?")

headers <- c("Mnemonic", "Description")
programmeDF <- data.frame(mnemonic, description)
colnames(programmeDF) <- headers

knitr::kable(
  programmeDF, longtable = TRUE, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'ECLIPSE questions'
)
```
