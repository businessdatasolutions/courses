## Prerequisites {-}

Before starting this module make sure you have:

* access to the book *Provost, F., & Fawcett, T. (2013). Data Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking. O'Reilly Media, Inc.*
* installed R and RStudio
* a Github account

## Purpose of this course {-}

The general learning outcome of this course is:

> The student is able to perform a well-defined task independently in a relatively clearly arranged situation, or is able to perform in a complex and unpredictable situation under supervision.

The course will provide you with a non-technical overview of data science, and types of techniques. The focus will lie on critical thinking and the full DS process (based on CRISP).
