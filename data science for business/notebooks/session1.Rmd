## Opdracht
Calculate for the given dataset the following statistical parameters:

* Mean
* Standard deviation
* Correlation

Use the functions from base R: `mean()`, `sd()` en `cor()`. Compare your results with the outcomes of other participants and discuss how likely it is that your samples are taken from the same dataset (e.g. manufacturing process).

```{r}
x <- myDF$x
y <- myDF$y

## Calculate the mean and standard deviation for x and y - Add your code below.

  
## Calculate the correlation between x and y - Add your code below.


```
