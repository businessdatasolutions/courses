## Business Case: Filtering Spam
In 2020 spam accounted for more than 50% of total e-mail traffic [@noauthor_spam_nodate]. This illustrates the value of a good spam filter. Naive Bayes spam filtering is a standard technique for handling spam. It is one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with roots in the 1990s.

## Data Understanding
The data we'll use comes from the SMS Spam Collection [@noauthor_uci_spam_nodate]. It contains a set of SMS messages that are labeled 'ham' or 'spam' and is a standard data set for testing spam filtering methods.

```{r}
url <- "datasets/smsspam.csv"
rawDF <- read_csv(url)
head(rawDF)
```

The dataset has `r dim(rawDF)[2]` variables (columns) and `r dim(rawDF)[1]` observations (rows).

The variable `type` is of class `character`. As it indicates whether the message belongs to the category ham or spam we should convert it to a `factor` variable.

```{r}
rawDF$type <- rawDF$type %>% factor %>% relevel("spam")
class(rawDF$type)
```

We can also visually inspect the data by creating wordclouds for each sms type.

```{r figures-side, fig.show="hold", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
spam <- rawDF %>% filter(type == "spam")
ham <- rawDF %>% filter(type == "ham")

wordcloud(spam$text, max.words = 20, scale = c(4, 0.8), colors= c("indianred1","indianred2","indianred3","indianred"))
wordcloud(ham$text, max.words = 20, scale = c(4, 0.8), colors= c("lightsteelblue1","lightsteelblue2","lightsteelblue3","lightsteelblue"))
```
**Question:**

* *What differences do you notice?*

## Preparation
First we need to create a corpus, which refers to a collection of text documents. In our case each sms is considered a text document. We'll use the `Corpus()` function from the`tm` package.

```{r}
rawCorpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(rawDF$text))
inspect(rawCorpus[1:3])
```

The corpus contains `r length(rawCorpus)` documents. Which obviously matches with the number of rows in our dataset.

We will use the function `tm_map()` to do some first cleaning up. First we'll change everything to lowercase. We'll also remove numbers as these will contain litle information on a message being spam or not.

```{r}
cleanCorpus <- rawCorpus %>% tm_map(tolower) %>% tm_map(removeNumbers)
```

For computation efficiency it is important to eliminate all items from a dataset of which you're rather confident that they' do'll add little information to your model. In our case we can expect that words like "and" or "but" will be equally common in both ham and spam messages. We should therefore filter them out before we start modeling. We'll also remove punctuation.

```{r}
cleanCorpus <- cleanCorpus %>% tm_map(tolower) %>% tm_map(removeWords, stopwords()) %>% tm_map(removePunctuation)
```
Now that we have removed certain items, the text lines contain a lot of whitespaces where these items used to be. In our last step we will remove additional whitespace.

```{r}
cleanCorpus <- cleanCorpus %>% tm_map(stripWhitespace)
```
Let's inspect the corpus again. Compare it to the raw version.

```{r}
tibble(Raw = rawCorpus$content[1:3], Clean = cleanCorpus$content[1:3])
```
Now that we have cleaned up the texts, we are going to transform the messages to a matrix. Each word in the each message will get its own column, each row will be a message and the cells of the matrix will contain a word count.

```{r}
cleanDTM <- cleanCorpus %>% DocumentTermMatrix
inspect(cleanDTM)
```

Before we start modeling we need to split all datasets into train and test sets. For this we will use a function from the `caret` package. The function `createDataPartition()` can be used to create balanced splits of the data. If the y argument to this function is a factor, the random sampling occurs within each class and should preserve the overall class distribution of the data. In this case we'll create a 75/25% split.

```{r}

# Create split indices
set.seed(1234)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(rawDF$type, p = .75, 
                                  list = FALSE, 
                                  times = 1)
head(trainIndex)

# Apply split indices to DF
trainDF <- rawDF[trainIndex, ]
testDF <- rawDF[-trainIndex, ]

# Apply split indices to Corpus
trainCorpus <- cleanCorpus[trainIndex]
testCorpus <- cleanCorpus[-trainIndex]

# Apply split indices to DTM
trainDTM <- cleanDTM[trainIndex, ]
testDTM <- cleanDTM[-trainIndex, ]
```

As you can check (how?) the DTM has almost `r round(dim(cleanDTM)[2], -2)` features. Remember that each feature in the DTM is a word. Some words will have very few counts and therefore will have limited predictive power. To save on computation time we will eliminate words with low frequencies.

```{r}
freqWords <- trainDTM %>% findFreqTerms(5)
trainDTM <-  DocumentTermMatrix(trainCorpus, list(dictionary = freqWords))
testDTM <-  DocumentTermMatrix(testCorpus, list(dictionary = freqWords))
```

With this operation we've reduced the number of features to around `r round(dim(trainDTM)[2], -2)`.

Another issue is that the Naive Bayes classifier is typically trained on categorical features. We now have numerical matrix with word counts. We will transform the counts into a factor that simply indicates whether the word appears in the document or not. We'll first build our own function for this and then apply it to each column in the DTM.

```{r}
convert_counts <- function(x) {
  x <- ifelse(x > 0, 1, 0) %>% factor(levels = c(0,1), labels = c("No", "Yes"))
}

nColsDTM <- dim(trainDTM)[2]
trainDTM <- apply(trainDTM, MARGIN = 2, convert_counts)
testDTM <- apply(testDTM, MARGIN = 2, convert_counts)

head(trainDTM[,1:10])
```


## Modeling and Evaluation

We have now everything in place to start training our model and evaluate against our test dataset. The `naiveBayes()` function is part of the `e1071` package. It takes in the features and labels of our training dataset and returns a trained model.

```{r}
nbayesModel <-  naiveBayes(trainDTM, trainDF$type, laplace = 1)
```

The model van be applied to the test features using the `predict()` funtion which generates a vector of predictions. Using a confusion matrix we can analyze the performance of our model.

```{r difftable1-fig, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=.75, fig.cap='Standard diffusion table. Taken from: https://emj.bmj.com/content/emermed/36/7/431/F1.large.jpg', message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep('images/diffusion.png'))
```

```{r}
predVec <- predict(nbayesModel, testDTM)
confusionMatrix(predVec, testDF$type, positive = "spam", dnn = c("Prediction", "True"))
```

**Questions:** 

1. *What do you think is the role of the `laplace` parameter in the `naiveBayes()` function?*
2. *How would you assess the overall performance of the model?*
3. *What would you consider as more costly: high false negatives or high false positives levels? Why?*
